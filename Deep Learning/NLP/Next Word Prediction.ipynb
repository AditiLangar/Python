thin compared with the size of the rest of him  waved about helplessly as he looked    What s happened to me   he thought   It wasn t a dream   His room  a proper human room although a little too small  lay peacefully between its four familiar walls   A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table   Samsa was a travelling salesman   and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice  gilded frame   It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright  raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer   Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather  Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane  which made him feel quite sad    How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense   he thought  but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right  and in his present state couldn t get into that position   However hard he threw himself onto his right  he always rolled back to where he was   He must have tried it a hundred times  shut his eyes so that he wouldn t have to look at the floundering legs  and only stopped when he began to feel a mild  dull pain there that he had never felt before    Oh  God   he thought   what a strenuous career it is that I ve chosen  Travelling day in and day out   Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home  and on top of that there s the curse of travelling  worries about making train connections  bad and irregular food  contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them   It can all go to Hell    He felt a slight itch up on his belly  pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better  found where the itch was  and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn t know what to make of  and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder   He slid back into his former position    Getting up early all the time   he thought   it makes you stupid   You ve got to get enough sleep   Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury   For instance  whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract  these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts   I ought to just try that with my boss  I d get kicked out on the spot   But who knows  maybe that would be the best thing for me   If I didn t have my parents to think about I d have given in my notice a long time ago  I d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think  tell him everything I would  let him know just what I feel   He d fall right off his desk  And it s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk  talking down at your subordinates from up there  especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing   Well  there s still some hope  once I ve got the money together to pay off my parents  debt to him   another five or six years I suppose   that s definitely what I ll do   That s when I ll make the big change   First of all though  I ve got to get up  my train leaves at five    And he looked over at the alarm clock  ticking on the chest of drawers    God in Heaven   he thought   It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards  it was even later than half past  more like quarter to seven   Had the alarm clock not rung  He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o clock as it should have been  it certainly must have rung   Yes  but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture rattling noise  True  he had not slept peacefully  but probably all the more deeply because of that   What should he do now  The next train went at seven  if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed  and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively   And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o clock train go  he would have put in his report about Gregor s not being there a long time ago   The office assistant was the boss s man  spineless  and with no understanding   What about if he reported sick  But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill   His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company  accuse his parents of having a lazy son  and accept the doctor s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no one was ever ill but that many were workshy   And what s more  would he have been entirely wrong in this case  Gregor did in fact  apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long  feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual   He was still hurriedly thinking all this through  unable to decide to get out of the bed  when the clock struck quarter to seven  There was a cautious knock at the door near his head    Gregor   somebody called   it was his mother    it s quarter to seven  Didn t you want to go somewhere    That gentle voice  Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering  it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before   As if from deep inside him  there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it  the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear  leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not   Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything  but in the circumstances contented himself with saying   Yes  mother  yes  thank you  I m getting up now    The change in Gregor s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door  as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away   But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor  against their expectations was still at home  and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors  gently  but with his fist   Gregor  Gregor   he called   what s wrong    And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice   Gregor  Gregor    At the other side door his sister came plaintively   Gregor  Aren t you well  Do you need anything    Gregor answered to both sides   I m ready  now   making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each  individual word   His father went back to his breakfast  but his sister whispered   Gregor  open the door  I beg of you    Gregor  however  had no thought of opening the door  and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit  acquired from his travelling  of locking all doors at night even when he was at home   The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed  to get dressed  and most of all to have his breakfast  Only then would he consider what to do next  as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed   He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed  perhaps caused by lying awkwardly  but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today   He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold  which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen   It was a simple matter to throw off the covers  he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves   But it became difficult after that  especially as he was so exceptionally broad  He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up  but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions  and which he was moreover unable to control   If he wanted to bend one of them  then that was the first one that would stretch itself out  and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg  all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully    This is something that can t be done in bed   Gregor said to himself   so don t keep trying to do it    The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed  but he had never seen this lower part  and could not imagine what it looked like  it turned out to be too hard to move  it went so slowly  and finally  almost in a frenzy  when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather  he chose the wrong direction  hit hard against the lower bedpost  and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well  at present  be the most sensitive   So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first  carefully turning his head to the side   This he managed quite easily  and despite its breadth and its weight  the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head  But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured  so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way   And he could not knock himself out now at any price  better to stay in bed than lose consciousness   It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier  but when he lay there sighing  and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before  if that was possible  he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos   He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice   At the same time  though  he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions   At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could  but unfortunately  even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him    Seven o clock  already   he said to himself when the clock struck again   seven o clock  and there s still a fog like this    And he lay there quietly a while longer  breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state   But then he said to himself   Before it strikes quarter past seven I ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed   And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what s happened to me as well  as they open up at work before seven o clock    And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time   If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it   His back seemed to be quite hard  and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet   His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make  and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm   But it was something that had to be risked   When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed   the new method was more of a game than an effort  all he had to do was rock back and forth   it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him   Two strong people   he had his father and the maid in mind   would have been more than enough  they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back  peel him away from the bed  bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor  where  hopefully  the little legs would find a use   Should he really call for help though  even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked  Despite all the difficulty he was in  he could not suppress a smile at this thought   After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard   The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon   Then there was a ring at the door of the flat   That ll be someone from work   he said to himself  and froze very still  although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around   For a moment everything remained quiet   They re not opening the door   Gregor said to himself  caught in some nonsensical hope   But then of course  the maid s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it   Gregor only needed to hear the visitor s first words of greeting and he knew who it was   the chief clerk himself   Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming  Were all employees  every one of them  louts  was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn t get out of bed if he didn t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business  Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries   assuming enquiries were even necessary   did the chief clerk have to come himself  and did they have to show the whole  innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it  And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision  he swang himself with all his force out of the bed   There was a loud thump  but it wasn t really a loud noise   His fall was softened a little by the carpet  and Gregor s back was also more elastic than he had thought  which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable   He had not held his head carefully enough  though  and hit it as he fell  annoyed and in pain  he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet    Something s fallen down in there   said the chief clerk in the room on the left   Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too  you had to concede that it was possible   But as if in gruff reply to this question  the chief clerk s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room  From the room on his right  Gregor s sister whispered to him to let him know   Gregor  the chief clerk is here     Yes  I know   said Gregor to himself  but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him    Gregor   said his father now from the room to his left   the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn t leave on the early train   We don t know what to say to him   And anyway  he wants to speak to you personally   So please open up this door   I m sure he ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room   Then the chief clerk called  Good morning   Mr  Samsa    He isn t well   said his mother to the chief clerk  while his father continued to speak through the door    He isn t well  please believe me   Why else would Gregor have missed a train  The lad only ever thinks about the business   It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings  he s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening   He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables   His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw   He s made a little frame  for instance  it only took him two or three evenings  you ll be amazed how nice it is  it s hanging up in his room  you ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door   Anyway  I m glad you re here  we wouldn t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves  he s so stubborn  and I m sure he isn t well  he said this morning that he is  but he isn t     I ll be there in a moment   said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully  but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation    Well I can t think of any other way of explaining it   Mrs  Samsa   said the chief clerk   I hope it s nothing serious   But on the other hand  I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then  fortunately or unfortunately as you like  we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations     Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then    asked his father impatiently  knocking at the door again    No   said Gregor   In the room on his right there followed a painful silence  in the room on his left his sister began to cry   So why did his sister not go and join the others  She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed   And why was she crying  Was it because he had not got up  and had not let the chief clerk in  because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before  There was no need to worry about things like that yet   Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family   For the time being he just lay there on the carpet  and no one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in   It was only a minor discourtesy  and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on  it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot   And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying   But the others didn t know what was happening  they were worried  that would excuse their behaviour   The chief clerk now raised his voice   Mr  Samsa   he called to him   what is wrong  You barricade yourself in your room  give us no more than yes or no for an answer  you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail   and I mention this just by the way   you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of   I m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer  and really must request a clear and immediate explanation   I am astonished  quite astonished   I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person  and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims   This morning  your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear  it s true   it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you   but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation   But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf   And nor is your position all that secure   I had originally intended to say all this to you in private  but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don t see why your parents should not also learn of it  Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late  I grant you that it s not the time of year to do especially good business  we recognise that  but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all   Mr  Samsa  we cannot allow there to be     But Sir   called Gregor  beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement   I ll open up immediately  just a moment   I m slightly unwell  an attack of dizziness  I haven t been able to get up   I m still in bed now   I m quite fresh again now  though   I m just getting out of bed   Just a moment   Be patient  It s not quite as easy as I d thought   I m quite alright now  though   It s shocking  what can suddenly happen to a person  I was quite alright last night  my parents know about it  perhaps better than me  I had a small symptom of it last night already   They must have noticed it   I don t know why I didn t let you know at work  But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home   Please  don t make my parents suffer  There s no basis for any of the accusations you re making  nobody s ever said a word to me about any of these things   Maybe you haven t read the latest contracts I sent in   I ll set off with the eight o clock train  as well  these few hours of rest have given me strength   You don t need to wait  sir  I ll be in the office soon after you  and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him    And while Gregor gushed out these words  hardly knowing what he was saying  he made his way over to the chest of drawers   this was easily done  probably because of the practise he had already had in bed   where he now tried to get himself upright   He really did want to open the door  really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk  the others were being so insistent  and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him  If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor s responsibility and he could rest   If  however  they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset  and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o clock   The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again  but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright  the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it   Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs   By now he had also calmed down  and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying    Did you understand a word of all that   the chief clerk asked his parents   surely he s not trying to make fools of us    Oh  God   called his mother  who was already in tears   he could be seriously ill and we re making him suffer   Grete  Grete   she then cried   Mother   his sister called from the other side   They communicated across Gregor s room    You ll have to go for the doctor straight away   Gregor is ill   Quick  get the doctor   Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now     That was the voice of an animal   said the chief clerk  with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother s screams    Anna  Anna   his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall  clapping his hands   get a locksmith here  now   And the two girls  their skirts swishing  immediately ran out through the hall  wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went   How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly  There was no sound of the door banging shut again  they must have left it open   people often do in homes where something awful has happened   Gregor  in contrast  had become much calmer   So they couldn t understand his words any more  although they seemed clear enough to him  clearer than before   perhaps his ears had become used to the sound   They had realised  though  that there was something wrong with him  and were ready to help   The first response to his situation had been confident and wise  and that made him feel better   He felt that he had been drawn back in among people  and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements   although he did not really distinguish one from the other   Whatever was said next would be crucial  so  in order to make his voice as clear as possible  he coughed a little  but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself   Meanwhile  it had become very quiet in the next room   Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk  or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening   Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair   Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door  holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs   He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth   He seemed  unfortunately  to have no proper teeth   how was he  then  to grasp the key    but the lack of teeth was  of course  made up for with a very strong jaw  using the jaw  he really was able to start the key turning  ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth  flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor   Listen   said the chief clerk in the next room   he s turning the key    Gregor was greatly encouraged by this  but they all should have been calling to him  his father and his mother too   Well done  Gregor   they should have cried   keep at it  keep hold of the lock    And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts  he bit on the key with all his strength  paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself   As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it  only holding himself upright with his mouth  and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed   The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor s sign that he could break his concentration  and as he regained his breath he said to himself   So  I didn t need the locksmith after all   Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely   Because he had to open the door in this way  it was already wide open before he could be seen   He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors  and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room   He was still occupied with this difficult movement  unable to pay attention to anything else  when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud  Oh    which sounded like the soughing of the wind  Now he also saw him   he was the nearest to the door   his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force   Gregor s mother  her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk s being there  looked at his father   Then she unfolded her arms  took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast   His father looked hostile  and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room   Then he looked uncertainly round the living room  covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook   So Gregor did not go into the room  but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place   In this way only half of his body could be seen  along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others  Meanwhile the day had become much lighter  part of the endless  grey black building on the other side of the street   which was a hospital   could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its facade  the rain was still falling  now throwing down large  individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time   The washing up from breakfast lay on the table  there was so much of it because  for Gregor s father  breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers   On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army  his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing   The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below    Now  then   said Gregor  well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm   I ll get dressed straight away now  pack up my samples and set off   Will you please just let me leave  You can see   he said to the chief clerk   that I m not stubborn and I like to do my job  being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn t earn my living   So where are you going  in to the office  Yes  Will you report everything accurately  then  It s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work  but that s just the right time to remember what s been achieved in the past and consider that later on  once the difficulty has been removed  he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration   You re well aware that I m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister  so that I m trapped in a difficult situation  but I will work my way out of it again   Please don t make things any harder for me than they are already  and don t take sides against me at the office   I know that nobody likes the travellers   They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it   That s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it   But you  sir  you have a better overview than the rest of the staff  in fact  if I can say this in confidence  a better overview than the boss himself   it s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should   And you re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office  so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints  and it s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing  we don t usually even hear about them  or if at all it s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip  and that s when we feel the harmful effects of what s been going on without even knowing what caused them   Please  don t go away  at least first say something to show that you grant that I m at least partly right    But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak  and  with protruding lips  only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left   He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking  but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him   He moved very gradually  as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room   It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement  drew his foot from the living room  and rushed forward in a panic   In the hall  he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there  there were some supernatural force waiting to save him   Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger   That was something his parents did not understand very well  over the years  they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life  and besides  they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future   Gregor  though  did think about the future   The chief clerk had to be held back  calmed down  convinced and finally won over  the future of Gregor and his family depended on it  If only his sister were here  She was clever  she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back   And the chief clerk was a lover of women  surely she could persuade him  she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state   But his sister was not there  Gregor would have to do the job himself   And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state  or that his speech still might not   or probably would not   be understood  he let go of the door  pushed himself through the opening  tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who  ridiculously  was holding on to the banister with both hands  but Gregor fell immediately over and  with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto  landed on his numerous little legs   Hardly had that happened than  for the first time that day  he began to feel alright with his body  the little legs had the solid ground under them  to his pleasure  they did exactly as he told them  they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go  and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end   He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor   His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed  at first  quite engrossed in herself  but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting   Help  for pity s sake  Help    The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better  but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not  she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it  when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing  without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet    Mother  mother   said Gregor gently  looking up at her   He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment  but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee   That set his mother screaming anew  she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her  Gregor  though  had no time to spare for his parents now  the chief clerk had already reached the stairs  with his chin on the banister  he looked back for the last time   Gregor made a run for him  he wanted to be sure of reaching him  the chief clerk must have expected something  as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared  his shouts resounding all around the staircase   The flight of the chief clerk seemed  unfortunately  to put Gregor s father into a panic as well   Until then he had been relatively self controlled  but now  instead of running after the chief clerk himself  or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him  Gregor s father seized the chief clerk s stick in his right hand  the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair  along with his hat and overcoat   picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left  and used them to drive Gregor back into his room  stamping his foot at him as he went   Gregor s appeals to his father were of no help  his appeals were simply not understood  however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder  Across the room  despite the chilly weather  Gregor s mother had pulled open a window  leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face   A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway  the curtains flew up  the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor   Nothing would stop Gregor s father as he drove him back  making hissing noises at him like a wild man   Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly   If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away  but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient  and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father s hand any moment   Eventually  though  Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw  to his disgust  that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line  so he began  as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father  to turn himself round   It went very slowly  but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him  in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn   If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing  It was making Gregor quite confused   When he had nearly finished turning round  still listening to that hissing  he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come   He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway  but then saw that it was too narrow  and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty   In his present mood  it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through   He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible   Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway   What he did  making more noise than ever  was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way  it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him  it was not a pleasant experience  and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen   One side of his body lifted itself  he lay at an angle in the doorway  one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured  leaving vile brown flecks on it  soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself  the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground   Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying  and heavily bleeding  deep into his room   The door was slammed shut with the stick  then  finally  all was quiet     II   It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma like sleep   He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn t been disturbed  as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested   But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him   The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture  but down below  where Gregor was  it was dark   He pushed himself over to the door  feeling his way clumsily with his antennae   of which he was now beginning to learn the value   in order to see what had been happening there   The whole of his left side seemed like one  painfully stretched scar   and he limped badly on his two rows of legs   One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning   it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been   and dragged along lifelessly   It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it  it was the smell of something to eat   By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it   He was so pleased he almost laughed  as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning  and immediately dipped his head into the milk  nearly covering his eyes with it   But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment  not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food   he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole   but the milk did not taste at all nice   Milk like this was normally his favourite drink  and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that  but he turned  almost against his own will  away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room   Through the crack in the door  Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room   His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper  reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor s mother  and sometimes to his sister  but there was now not a sound to be heard   Gregor s sister would often write and tell him about this reading  but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times   It was so quiet all around too  even though there must have been somebody in the flat    What a quiet life it is the family lead   said Gregor to himself  and  gazing into the darkness  felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents   But what now  if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end  That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much  so he started to move about  crawling up and down the room   Once during that long evening  the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again  later on the door on the other side did the same  it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it   Gregor went and waited immediately by the door  resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was  but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain   The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him  but now  now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day  no one came  and the keys were in the other sides   It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out  and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time  as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip toe   It was clear that no one would come into Gregor s room any more until morning  that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re arrange his life   For some reason  the tall  empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor  even though he had been living in it for five years   Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame  he hurried under the couch   It pressed down on his back a little  and he was no longer able to lift his head  but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath   He spent the whole night there   Some of the time he passed in a light sleep  although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger  and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which  however  always led to the same conclusion  for the time being he must remain calm  he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he  in his present condition  was forced to impose on them   Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions  as early the next morning  almost before the night had ended  his sister  nearly fully dressed  opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in   She did not see him straight away  but when she did notice him under the couch   he had to be somewhere  for God s sake  he couldn t have flown away   she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside   But she seemed to regret her behaviour  as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger  Gregor had pushed his head forward  right to the edge of the couch  and watched her   Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was  realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable  If she didn t do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it  although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch  throw himself at his sister s feet and beg her for something good to eat   However  his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise   She immediately picked it up   using a rag  not her bare hands   and carried it out   Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place  imagining the wildest possibilities  but he never could have guessed what his sister  in her goodness  actually did bring   In order to test his taste  she brought him a whole selection of things  all spread out on an old newspaper   There were old  half rotten vegetables  bones from the evening meal  covered in white sauce that had gone hard  a few raisins and almonds  some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before  a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt   As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish  which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor s use  and placed it beside them   Then  out of consideration for Gregor s feelings  as she knew that he would not eat in front of her  she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked   Gregor s little legs whirred  at last he could eat   What s more  his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving   This amazed him  as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife  he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday   Am I less sensitive than I used to be  then    he thought  and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately  almost compellingly  attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper   Quickly one after another  his eyes watering with pleasure  he consumed the cheese  the vegetables and the sauce  the fresh foods  on the other hand  he didn t like at all  and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn t stand the smell   Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place  his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw   He was immediately startled  although he had been half asleep  and he hurried back under the couch   But he needed great self control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room  as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space   Half suffocating  he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left overs  mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more  She quickly dropped it all into a bin  closed it with its wooden lid  and carried everything out   She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself   This was how Gregor received his food each day now  once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep  and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well  and Gregor s sister would send the maid away on some errand   Gregor s father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either  but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it  and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough   It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat   As nobody could understand him  nobody  not even his sister  thought that he could understand them  so he had to be content to hear his sister s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room   It was only later  when she had become a little more used to everything   there was  of course  no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation   that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment  or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly    He s enjoyed his dinner today   she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him  or if he left most of it  which slowly became more and more frequent  she would often say  sadly   now everything s just been left there again    Although Gregor wasn t able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms  and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it   There was seldom any conversation  especially at first  that was not about him in some way  even if only in secret   For two whole days  all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now  but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home   nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty   And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor s mother to let her go without delay   It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour  tearfully thanking Gregor s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service   She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened  even though no one had asked that of her   Now Gregor s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking  although that was not so much bother as no one ate very much  Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat  and receive no more answer than  no thanks  I ve had enough  or something similar   No one drank very much either   His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer  hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself   When his father then said nothing she would add  so that he would not feel selfish  that she could send the housekeeper for it  but then his father would close the matter with a big  loud  No   and no more would be said   Even before the first day had come to an end  his father had explained to Gregor s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were   Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier   Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted   What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room   He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father s business  at least he had never told him anything different  and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway  Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair  and Gregor s only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible   So then he started working especially hard  with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight  bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways   Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family   They had been good times and they had never come again  at least not with the same splendour  even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family  and did bear them   They had even got used to it  both Gregor and the family  they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it  although there was no longer much warm affection given in return  Gregor only remained close to his sister now   Unlike him  she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist  it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way   During Gregor s short periods in town  conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised   Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk  but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day   That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state  pressed upright against the door and listening   There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening  when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start  as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent    What s that he s doing now   his father would say after a while  clearly having gone over to the door  and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again   When explaining things  his father repeated himself several times  partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor s mother did not understand everything the first time   From these repeated explanations Gregor learned  to his pleasure  that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days   It was not a lot  but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated   Besides that  they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month  keeping only a little for himself  so that that  too  had been accumulating  Behind the door  Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution   He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father s debt to his boss  and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer  but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things   This money  however  was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest  it was enough to maintain them for  perhaps  one or two years  no more   That s to say  it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies  money to live on had to be earned   His father was healthy but old  and lacking in self confidence   During the five years that he had not been working   the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success   he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy   Would Gregor s elderly mother now have to go and earn money  She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home  every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window   Would his sister have to go and earn money  She was still a child of seventeen  her life up till then had been very enviable  consisting of wearing nice clothes  sleeping late  helping out in the business  joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin   Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money  Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool  leather sofa next to it  as he became quite hot with shame and regret   He would often lie there the whole night through  not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end   Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window  climbing up onto the sill and  propped up in the chair  leaning on the window to stare out of it   He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this  but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced   as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day  even things that were quite near  he had used to curse the ever present view of the hospital across the street  but now he could not see it at all  and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse  which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city  he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably   His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room  and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on   If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it  but as it was it caused him pain   His sister  naturally  tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it  and the longer it went on  of course  the better she was able to do so  but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better   It had even become very unpleasant for him  now  whenever she entered the room   No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no one would have to suffer the view into Gregor s room  then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating   Even if it was cold  she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while   She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making  he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while  knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal  but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed   One day  about a month after Gregor s transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance  she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window  motionless  and just where he would be most horrible   In itself  his sister s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there  but not only did she not come in  she went straight back and closed the door behind her  a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her   Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch  of course  but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual   It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so  she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch   One day  in order to spare her even this sight  he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down  If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again  as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely   She left the sheet where it was   Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement   For the first fourteen days  Gregor s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him   He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though  before  they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her   But now the two of them  father and mother  would often both wait outside the door of Gregor s room while his sister tidied up in there  and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked  what Gregor had eaten  how he had behaved this time and whether  perhaps  any slight improvement could be seen  His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it   Gregor listened very closely to all this  and approved fully   Later  though  she had to be held back by force  which made her call out   Let me go and see Gregor  he is my unfortunate son  Can t you understand I have to see him    and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in  not every day of course  but one day a week  perhaps  she could understand everything much better than his sister who  for all her courage  was still just a child after all  and really might not have had an adult s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on   Gregor s wish to see his mother was soon realised   Out of consideration for his parents  Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day  the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about  it was hard to just lie quietly through the night  his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all  and so  to entertain himself  he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling   He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling  it was quite different from lying on the floor  he could breathe more freely  his body had a light swing to it  and up there  relaxed and almost happy  it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash   But now  of course  he had far better control of his body than before and  even with a fall as great as that  caused himself no damage   Very soon his sister noticed Gregor s new way of entertaining himself   he had  after all  left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about   and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way  especially the chest of drawers and the desk   Now  this was not something that she would be able to do by herself  she did not dare to ask for help from her father  the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this  she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important  so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her   As she approached the room  Gregor could hear his mother express her joy  but once at the door she went silent   First  of course  his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright  and only then did she let her mother enter   Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance   Gregor also refrained  this time  from spying out from under the sheet  he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come    You can come in  he can t be seen   said his sister  obviously leading her in by the hand   The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about  but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place  his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother s warnings that she would strain herself   This lasted a very long time   After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was  for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more  and for another thing it wasn t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him   She thought just the opposite  the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart  and why wouldn t Gregor feel the same way about it  he d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that   Then  quietly  almost whispering as if wanting Gregor  whose whereabouts she did not know  to hear not even the tone of her voice  as she was convinced that he did not understand her words  she added  and by taking the furniture away  won t it seem like we re showing that we ve given up all hope of improvement and we re abandoning him to cope for himself  I think it d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he ll find everything unchanged and he ll be able to forget the time in between all the easier    Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication  along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months  must have made him confused   he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out   Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave  a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited  That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction  but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human   He had come very close to forgetting  and it had only been the voice of his mother  unheard for so long  that had shaken him out of it   Nothing should be removed  everything had to stay  he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition  and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage   His sister  unfortunately  did not agree  she had become used to the idea  not without reason  that she was Gregor s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him   This meant that his mother s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk  as she had thought at first  but all the furniture apart from the all important couch   It was more than childish perversity  of course  or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired  that made her insist  she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in  whereas the furniture  as far as anyone could see  was of no use to him at all   Girls of that age  though  do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can   Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor s situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him   Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself   So she refused to let her mother dissuade her   Gregor s mother already looked uneasy in his room  she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had   The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to  but the writing desk had to stay  Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers  groaning  out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it   He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could  but  unfortunately  it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest  pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without  of course  moving it an inch   His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor  he might have made her ill  so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch   In his startlement  though  he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little   It was enough to attract his mother s attention   She stood very still  remained there a moment  and then went back out to Grete   Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening  it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all  but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro  their little calls to each other  the scraping of the furniture on the floor  all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides   With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor  he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer   They were emptying his room out  taking away everything that was dear to him  they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools  now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor  the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee  at high school  even while he had been at infant school  he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women s intentions were good   He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway  as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor   So  while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath  he sallied out  changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall   which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it   of the lady dressed in copious fur   He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass  it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly   This picture at least  now totally covered by Gregor  would certainly be taken away by no one   He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back   They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon  Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her    What shall we take now  then    said Grete and looked around   Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall   Perhaps only because her mother was there  she remained calm  bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said  albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice   Come on  let s go back in the living room for a while    Gregor could see what Grete had in mind  she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall   Well  she could certainly try it  He sat unyielding on his picture   He would rather jump at Grete s face   But Grete s words had made her mother quite worried  she stepped to one side  saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper  and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed   Oh God  oh God    Arms outstretched  she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile   Gregor   shouted his sister  glowering at him and shaking her fist   That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation   She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint  Gregor wanted to help too   he could save his picture later  although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force  then he  too  ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days  but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing  she was looking into various bottles  he startled her when she turned round  a bottle fell to the ground and broke  a splinter cut Gregor s face  some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him  now  without delaying any longer  Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother  she slammed the door shut with her foot   So now Gregor was shut out from his mother  who  because of him  might be near to death  he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away  and she had to stay with his mother  there was nothing for him to do but wait  and  oppressed with anxiety and self reproach  he began to crawl about  he crawled over everything  walls  furniture  ceiling  and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table   He lay there for a while  numb and immobile  all around him it was quiet  maybe that was a good sign   Then there was someone at the door   The maid  of course  had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it   His father had arrived home    What s happened   were his first words  Grete s appearance must have made everything clear to him   She answered him with subdued voice  and openly pressed her face into his chest   Mother s fainted  but she s better now   Gregor got out     Just as I expected   said his father   just as I always said  but you women wouldn t listen  would you    It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened  that he was responsible for some act of violence  That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father  as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible   So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father  when he came in from the hall  could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay  that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear   His father  though  was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that   Ah    he shouted as he came in  sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time   Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father   He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now  of late  with his new habit of crawling about  he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before   He really ought to have expected things to have changed  but still  still  was that really his father  The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips  who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings  who was hardly even able to stand up but  as a sign of his pleasure  would just raise his arms and who  on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother  would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them  who were already walking slowly for his sake  who would place his stick down carefully and  if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him   He was standing up straight enough now  dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons  the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute  above the high  stiff collar of the coat his strong double chin emerged  under the bushy eyebrows  his piercing  dark eyes looked out fresh and alert  his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp   He took his cap  with its gold monogram from  probably  some bank  and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa  put his hands in his trouser pockets  pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat  and  with look of determination  walked towards Gregor   He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind  but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high   Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots  but wasted no time with that   he knew full well  right from the first day of his new life  that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him   And so he ran up to his father  stopped when his father stopped  scurried forwards again when he moved  even slightly   In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening  without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly   Gregor remained all this time on the floor  largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling   Whatever he did  Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long  as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements  He became noticeably short of breath  even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable   Now  as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open  his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running  he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although  here  they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions   then  right beside him  lightly tossed  something flew down and rolled in front of him   It was an apple  then another one immediately flew at him  Gregor froze in shock  there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him   He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now  without even taking the time for careful aim  threw one apple after another   These little  red apples rolled about on the floor  knocking into each other as if they had electric motors   An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor s back and slid off without doing any harm   Another one however  immediately following it  hit squarely and lodged in his back  Gregor wanted to drag himself away  as if he could remove the surprising  the incredible pain by changing his position  but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out  all his senses in confusion   The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open  his sister was screaming  his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse  as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe   she ran to his father  her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground  stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father  her arms around him  uniting herself with him totally   now Gregor lost his ability to see anything   her hands behind his father s head begging him to spare Gregor s life     III   No one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor s flesh  so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury   He had suffered it there for more than a month  and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor  despite his current sad and revolting form  was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy   On the contrary  as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient  just to be patient   Because of his injuries  Gregor had lost much of his mobility   probably permanently   He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long  long minutes to crawl across his room   crawling over the ceiling was out of the question   but this deterioration in his condition was fully  in his opinion  made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening   He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then  lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room  he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation   with everyone s permission  in a way  and thus quite differently from before   They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times  of course  the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room   All of them were usually very quiet nowadays   Soon after dinner  his father would go to sleep in his chair  his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet  his mother  bent deeply under the lamp  would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop  his sister  who had taken a sales job  learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on  Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor s mother  you re doing so much sewing again today    as if he did not know that he had been dozing   and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin   With a kind of stubbornness  Gregor s father refused to take his uniform off even at home  while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor s father would slumber where he was  fully dressed  as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here   The uniform had not been new to start with  but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor s mother and sister to look after it   Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat  with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny  while the old man in it would sleep  highly uncomfortable but peaceful   As soon as it struck ten  Gregor s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed  as he couldn t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work   But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table  even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed   Then  however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up   Gregor s mother would tug at his sleeve  whisper endearments into his ear  Gregor s sister would leave her work to help her mother  but nothing would have any effect on him   He would just sink deeper into his chair   Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes  look at them one after the other and say   What a life  This is what peace I get in my old age    And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself  let the women take him to the door  send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor s mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him   Who  in this tired and overworked family  would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary  The household budget became even smaller  so now the maid was dismissed  an enormous  thick boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work  everything else was looked after by Gregor s mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did   Gregor even learned  listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for  that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold  even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations   But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances  they could not move out of it  there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address   He could see quite well  though  that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move  it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it  the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair  and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to   They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people  Gregor s father brought bank employees their breakfast  his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers  his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers  but they just did not have the strength to do any more   And the injury in Gregor s back began to hurt as much as when it was new   After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor s mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together  cheek to cheek  his mother would point to Gregor s room and say  Close that door  Grete   and then  when he was in the dark again  they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle  or they would simply sit there staring dry eyed at the table   Gregor hardly slept at all  either night or day   Sometimes he would think of taking over the family s affairs  just like before  the next time the door was opened  he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk  but they would appear again in his thoughts  the salesmen and the apprentices  that stupid teaboy  two or three friends from other businesses  one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel  a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again  a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow    all of them appeared to him  mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten  but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible  and he was glad when they disappeared   Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family  he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown  and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted  he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to  even if he was not hungry   Gregor s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday  and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom  indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or   more often than not   had been left totally untouched   She still cleared up the room in the evening  but now she could not have been any quicker about it   Smears of dirt were left on the walls  here and there were little balls of dust and filth   At first  Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her  but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it  she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it  At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood   cleaning up Gregor s room was for her and her alone   Gregor s mother did once thoroughly clean his room  and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it   although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch  bitter and immobile   But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done  as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregor s room and  highly aggrieved  ran back into the living room where  despite her mothers raised and imploring hands  she broke into convulsive tears   Her father  of course  was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless  then they  too  became agitated  Gregor s father  standing to the right of his mother  accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor s room to his sister  from her left  Gregor s sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor s room again  while his mother tried to draw his father  who was beside himself with anger  into the bedroom  his sister  quaking with tears  thumped on the table with her small fists  and Gregor hissed in anger that no one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise   Gregor s sister was exhausted from going out to work  and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her  but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place  Gregor  on the other hand  ought not to be neglected   Now  though  the charwoman was here   This elderly widow  with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life  wasn t really repelled by Gregor   Just by chance one day  rather than any real curiosity  she opened the door to Gregor s room and found herself face to face with him   He was taken totally by surprise  no one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her   From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him   At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly  such as  come on then  you old dung beetle    or  look at the old dung beetle there    Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way  but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened   If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it  One day  early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes  perhaps indicating that spring was coming  she began to speak to him in that way once again   Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her  he was slow and infirm  but it was like a kind of attack   Instead of being afraid  the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open  clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor s back   Aren t you coming any closer  then    she asked when Gregor turned round again  and she calmly put the chair back in the corner   Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating   Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it  leave it there a few hours and then  more often than not  spit it out again   At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating  but he had soon got used to the changes made there   They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else  and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen   These earnest gentlemen   all three of them had full beards  as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day   were painfully insistent on things  being tidy   This meant not only in their own room but  since they had taken a room in this establishment  in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen   Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate  especially if it was dirty   They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them   For this reason  many things had become superfluous which  although they could not be sold  the family did not wish to discard   All these things found their way into Gregor s room   The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too   The charwoman was always in a hurry  and anything she couldn t use for the time being she would just chuck in there   He  fortunately  would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it   The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity  or to throw everything out in one go  but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else   At first he moved it because  with no other room free where he could crawl about  he was forced to  but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death  and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards   The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone  and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening   But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open  he had  after all  often failed to make use of it when it was open and  without the family having noticed it  lain in his room in its darkest corner   One time  though  the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open  and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on  They sat up at the table where  formerly  Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother  they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks   Gregor s mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes   The food was steaming  and filled the room with its smell   The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it  and the gentleman in the middle  who seemed to count as an authority for the other two  did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish  clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen   It was to his satisfaction  and Gregor s mother and sister  who had been looking on anxiously  began to breathe again and smiled   The family themselves ate in the kitchen   Nonetheless  Gregor s father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen  bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table  The gentlemen stood as one  and mumbled something into their beards   Then  once they were alone  they ate in near perfect silence   It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard  as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be    I d like to eat something   said Gregor anxiously   but not anything like they re eating   They do feed themselves   And here I am  dying    Throughout all this time  Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played  but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen   The three gentlemen had already finished their meal  the one in the middle had produced a newspaper  given a page to each of the others  and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking   When the violin began playing they became attentive  stood up and went on tip toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other   Someone must have heard them in the kitchen  as Gregor s father called out   Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen  We can stop it straight away     On the contrary   said the middle gentleman   would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room  where it is  after all  much more cosy and comfortable     Oh yes  we d love to   called back Gregor s father as if he had been the violin player himself   The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited  Gregor s father soon appeared with the music stand  his mother with the music and his sister with the violin   She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing  his parents  who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen  did not even dare to sit on their own chairs  his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat  his mother  though  was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat   leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it   out of the way in a corner   His sister began to play  father and mother paid close attention  one on each side  to the movements of her hands   Drawn in by the playing  Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room   Before  he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others   What s more  there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement  he carried threads  hairs  and remains of food about on his back and sides  he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day   And despite this condition  he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room   No one noticed him  though   The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing  at first  the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played  and they must have disturbed Gregor s sister  but soon  in contrast with the family  they  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume  and they stayed by the window while Gregor s father observed them anxiously   It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed  that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed   It was especially unnerving  the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses   Yet Gregor s sister was playing so beautifully   Her face was leant to one side  following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression   Gregor crawled a little further forward  keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came   Was he an animal if music could captivate him so  It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for   He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin  as no one appreciated her playing here as much as he would   He never wanted to let her out of his room  not while he lived  anyway  his shocking appearance should  for once  be of some use to him  he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers  his sister should not be forced to stay with him  though  but stay of her own free will  she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory  how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas   had Christmas really come and gone already    if this misfortune hadn t got in the way  and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it   On hearing all this  his sister would break out in tears of emotion  and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck  which  since she had been going out to work  she had kept free without any necklace or collar    Mr  Samsa    shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor s father  pointing  without wasting any more words  with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward   The violin went silent  the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends  shaking his head  and then looked back at Gregor   His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out  even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been   He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body   Now they did become a little annoyed  and it was not clear whether it was his father s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it   They asked Gregor s father for explanations  raised their arms like he had  tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly   Meanwhile Gregor s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted   She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing  but then she suddenly pulled herself together  lay the instrument on her mother s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was  and ran into the next room which  under pressure from her father  the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward   Under his sister s experienced hand  the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room   Gregor s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants   He urged them and pressed them until  when he was already at the door of the room  the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor s father to a halt    I declare here and now   he said  raising his hand and glancing at Gregor s mother and sister to gain their attention too   that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family    here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor    I give immediate notice on my room   For the days that I have been living here I will  of course  pay nothing at all  on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you  and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action    He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something   And indeed  his two friends joined in with the words   And we also give immediate notice    With that  he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door   Gregor s father staggered back to his seat  feeling his way with his hands  and fell into it  it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all  Throughout all this  Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him   His disappointment at the failure of his plan  and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger  made it impossible for him to move   He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment  and he waited   He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor    Father  Mother   said his sister  hitting the table with her hand as introduction   we can t carry on like this   Maybe you can t see it  but I can   I don t want to call this monster my brother  all I can say is  we have to try and get rid of it   We ve done all that s humanly possible to look after it and be patient  I don t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong     She s absolutely right   said Gregor s father to himself   His mother  who still had not had time to catch her breath  began to cough dully  her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes   Gregor s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead   Her words seemed to give Gregor s father some more definite ideas   He sat upright  played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal  and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile    We have to try and get rid of it   said Gregor s sister  now speaking only to her father  as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen   it ll be the death of both of you  I can see it coming   We can t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this  we can t endure it   I can t endure it any more    And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother  and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements    My child   said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding   what are we to do    His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her  displacing her earlier certainty    If he could just understand us   said his father almost as a question  his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question    If he could just understand us   repeated Gregor s father  closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister s certainty that that was quite impossible   then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him   But as it is        It s got to go   shouted his sister   that s the only way  Father  You ve got to get rid of the idea that that s Gregor   We ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long   How can that be Gregor  If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it s not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will   We wouldn t have a brother any more  then  but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect   As it is this animal is persecuting us  it s driven out our tenants  it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets   Father  look  just look   she suddenly screamed   he s starting again     In her alarm  which was totally beyond Gregor s comprehension  his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor   She rushed over to behind her father  who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor s sister as if to protect her   But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone  least of all his sister   All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room  although that was in itself quite startling as his pain wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it  repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor   He stopped and looked round   They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly   Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence   His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other  her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion  his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck    Maybe now they ll let me turn round   thought Gregor and went back to work   He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest   No one was making him rush any more  everything was left up to him   As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead   He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room  and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it   He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word  not any cry  from his family to distract him  He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway   He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff  but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed  only his sister had stood up   With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep   He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut  bolted and locked   The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him   It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush   She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly  Gregor had not heard her coming at all  and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents  At last      What now  then    Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness   He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all   This was no surprise to him  it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural   He also felt relatively comfortable   It is true that his entire body was aching  but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether  He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it  which was entirely covered in white dust  He thought back of his family with emotion and love   If it was possible  he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister   He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning   He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too   Then  without his willing it  his head sank down completely  and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils   When the cleaner came in early in the morning   they d often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did  so that everyone in the flat knew when she d arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace   she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special   She thought he was laying there so still on purpose  playing the martyr  she attributed all possible understanding to him   She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand  so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway   When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little  and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention  She soon realised what had really happened  opened her eyes wide  whistled to herself  but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms   Come and  ave a look at this  it s dead  just lying there  stone dead    Mr  and  Mrs  Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying   But then  each from his own side  they hurried out of bed   Mr  Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders   Mrs  Samsa just came out in her nightdress  and that is how they went into Gregor s room   On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in  she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep  and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this   Dead    asked  Mrs  Samsa  looking at the charwoman enquiringly  even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking    That s what I said    replied the cleaner  and to prove it she gave Gregor s body another shove with the broom  sending it sideways across the floor   Mrs  Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom  but did not complete it    Now then   said  Mr  Samsa   let s give thanks to God for that   He crossed himself  and the three women followed his example   Grete  who had not taken her eyes from the corpse  said   Just look how thin he was   He didn t eat anything for so long  The food came out again just the same as when it went in   Gregor s body was indeed completely dried up and flat  they had not seen it until then  but now he was not lifted up on his little legs  nor did he do anything to make them look away    Grete  come with us in here for a little while   said  Mrs  Samsa with a pained smile  and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body   The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide   Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it   It was already the end of March  after all   The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts   they had been forgotten about   Where is our breakfast    the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably   She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor s room   They did so  and stood around Gregor s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well worn coats  It was now quite light in the room   Then the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr  Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other   All of them had been crying a little  Grete now and then pressed her face against her father s arm    Leave my home   Now    said  Mr  Samsa  indicating the door and without letting the women from him    What do you mean    asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted  and he smiled sweetly   The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour    I mean just what I said   answered  Mr  Samsa  and  with his two companions  went in a straight line towards the man   At first  he stood there still  looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions    Alright  we ll go then   he said  and looked up at  Mr  Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr  Samsa for his decision   Mr  Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times   At that  and without delay  the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway  his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said   Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr  Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader   Once there  all three took their hats from the stand  took their sticks from the holder  bowed without a word and left the premises   Mr  Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing  but they had had no reason to mistrust the men s intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps   As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later  the further down they went  the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them  when a butcher s boy  proud of posture with his tray on his head  passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were   Mr  Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went  as if relieved  back into the flat   They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk  not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it   So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal   Mr  Samsa to his employers   Mrs  Samsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal   The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going  she d finished her work for that morning   The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing  and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation    Well    asked  Mr  Samsa   The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report  but would only do it if she was clearly asked to   The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat  which had been a source of irritation to  Mr  Samsa all the time she had been working for them  swayed gently in all directions    What is it you want then    asked  Mrs  Samsa  whom the cleaner had the most respect for    Yes   she answered  and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away   well then  that thing in there  you needn t worry about how you re going to get rid of it   That s all been sorted out     Mrs  Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing   Mr  Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but  with outstretched hand  he made it quite clear that she was not to   So  as she was prevented from telling them all about it  she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and  clearly peeved  called out  Cheerio then  everyone   turned round sharply and left  slamming the door terribly as she went    Tonight she gets sacked   said  Mr  Samsa  but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained   They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other   Mr  Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while   Then he called out   Come here  then  Let s forget about all that old stuff  shall we   Come and give me a bit of attention   The two women immediately did as he said  hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters   After that  the three of them left the flat together  which was something they had not done for months  and took the tram out to the open country outside the town   They had the tram  filled with warm sunshine  all to themselves   Leant back comfortably on their seats  they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad   until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future   The greatest improvement for the time being  of course  would be achieved quite easily by moving house  what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor  one that was in a better location and  most of all  more practical   All the time  Grete was becoming livelier   With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale  but  while they were talking   Mr  and  Mrs  Samsa were struck  almost simultaneously  with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady   They became quieter   Just from each other s glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her   And  as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions  as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body '"
